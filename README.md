# Youtube Video To MP3 Verter ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ

ðŸ‘‹ Hello music lovers! Automate your Metube downloads conversion into MP3's and moving them into your favorite music library? This handy Bash script is here to save the day!

## What it does

* **Craptastically Semi-Cleans The Name:**  It does a piss poor job of cleaning up the name but it tries, come on video people stop it with the funny characters already.
* **Converts the MP4 or Webm to MP3:**  It converts each video in the Metube downloads folder into an MP3 and then moves it to your Music library for you.
* **Semi-Normalizes Track Gain:**  It tries, gimme a break.

## How to use it

1. **Make a backup:** Just in case, make a copy of your Metube downloads folder before running the script.
2. **Edit the path:** Open the `verter.sh` file and change the `/path/to/your/music/library` path to where your music lives.
3. **Place The File In Your Path and Run the script:**  Make sure to place the script in your environments path and do a `chmod +x verter.sh`.  Then from your terminal and type `verter.sh`.  

## Just hope it works, it's free after all!

Let the music play and if it doesn't do a PR with a fix and I'll update it! ðŸŽ‰
